# first-website

This was the first website that I have ever created (yes I did maybe steal some of the code but I was just experimenting at that time). I don't know why I even uploaded this to github since in general it's just bad and has no value but maybe some people are interested in it. I made this website in 2018 when I was first experimenting with coding, I enjoyed making it and I'm really happy with all the progress that I made since that time.
